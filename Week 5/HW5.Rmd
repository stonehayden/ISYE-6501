This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r HW 5 Q8.2}

rm(list = ls())



# Read data
uscrime <- read.table("uscrime.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)

# Linear regression model creation
lm_uscrime <- lm(Crime~., data = uscrime)

#show me the model
lm_uscrime

# Check the P-value for the regression model
summary(lm_uscrime)

#this model actually has a very high R2 

#however, it is unrealistically high (Dr. Sokol mentions R2 of <0.4 is often a really good model)

#this model's R2 is so high due to the model being overfit to the parameters

  
#Create the test data from HW document
test <-data.frame(M = 14.0,So = 0, Ed = 10.0, Po1 = 12.0, Po2 = 15.5,LF = 0.640, M.F = 94.0, Pop = 150, NW = 1.1, U1 = 0.120, U2 = 3.6, Wealth = 3200, Ineq = 20.1, Prob = 0.040,Time = 39.0)

#filter out p-values above 0.05 
filter_test <- data.frame(summary(lm_uscrime)$coef[summary(lm_uscrime)$coef[,4] <= .05, 4])

#show the predictors that made the cut
filter_test

#create model using parameters found above
#rule of thumb (from office hours) is at least 10 data points per parameter
#so 4 parameters is a good amount 
lm_uscrime0.05 <-lm(Crime~M+Ed+Ineq+Prob,uscrime)
summary(lm_uscrime0.05)

#this model shows a much lower R2 than the previous model
#however this model will be more accurate to other test data
#because we only took parameters that were meaningful from the data

#predict crime rate
prediction <- predict(lm_uscrime0.05,test)
#show predicted crime rate
prediction

#crime rate seems reasonable and the model does not appear to be overfit :)
