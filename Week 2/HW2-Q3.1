## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r HW2-Q3.1}

library(kernlab)
library(kknn)
library(ggplot2)

rm(list = ls())

set.seed(1)
data <- read.table("credit_card_data.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = FALSE)
head(data)

model=train.kknn(V11~.,data,kmax=10, scale=TRUE)
# Accuracy Matrix
model_accry=rep(0,30)
# calculate prediction qualities
for (k in 1:10) {
model_predicted <- as.integer(fitted(model)[[k]][1:nrow(data)] + 0.5)
model_accry[k] <- sum(model_predicted == data$V11)
}
# show accuracies
model_accry

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
