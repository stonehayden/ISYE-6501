When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r HW 4 Q7.2}

#read the data
temps <- read.table("temps.txt", stringsAsFactors = F, header = T)
#verify data

#Red line is model data, black line is actual data
#Model doesn't begin right away because it needs some data to start

#lets look at seasonal factors (cyclical data)

#temps_HW_smoothed is now our smoothed matrix
#now we need to test if the unofficial end of summer has gotten later

#the Summer -> Fall calendar date is typically around September 21
#so lets our model's expected temperatures for September 21 over time

#if the temperature on September 21 is increasing over time, then the end of summer is coming later

#lets see what happens

}
#show September 21 temp data
sept_21
#plot the temp data in a line graph
plot(sept_21, type = "o")

#there is clearly no trend in the smoothed temperature data over time
#therefore we reject the hypothesis that the unofficial end of summer is getting
