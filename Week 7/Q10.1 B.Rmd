When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r HW7 Q10.1 B}

#setup libraries
rm(list = ls())
library(DAAG)
library(tree)
library(randomForest)

#read data and display top of it
data <- read.table("uscrime.txt", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
head(data)

#create randomforest model and set number of predictors to be sampled at each tree
num_random <- 4
forest <- randomForest(Crime~., data = data, mtry = num_random, importance = TRUE)
#show the randomforest results
forest

#let's calculate SSres of the model (same as part A)
predict <- predict(forest)
SSres <- sum((predict-data$Crime)^2)
SSres

#plot model prediction vs actual results (following steps of part A)
plot(data$Crime, predict)
abline(0,1)
plot(data$Crime, scale(predict - data$Crime))
abline(0,0)

#show me the R2 quality of fit
SS <- sum((data$Crime - mean(data$Crime))^2)
R2 <- 1 - SSres/SS
R2
#R2 shows a much lower quality of fit than the regression tree model from part A
#let's cross validate for testing
SSE <- 0
for (i in 1:nrow(data)) {
  rd <- randomForest(Crime~., data = data[-i,], mtry = num_random)
  SSE = SSE + (predict(rd,newdata=data[i,]) - data[i,16])^2
}
1 - SSE/SS
#since a random forest 'averages out' overfitting, this model is most likely more accurate than the tree from part A
#however the disadvantage to this random forest model, is that we do not get to see a real, repeatable model
#

#we can also see through part A and B that Po1 being either lesser/greater than 7.65 is the most important factor among all crime factors
#the following shows the weight or importance of each variable
importance(forest)

#we can see that Po1 is the most important, as observed previously
#but we can also see that Po2, NW, and Prob are the next most important factors
